<b>Abstract:</b> The environment, as part of the earth, is also an indispensable part of people's lives. However, people's excessive dependence on the environment has caused serious damage to it, such as carbon dioxide emissions from driving, sewage from factories and garbage from people. Environmental problems have become a paramount problem nowadays, and many people have begun to pay attention to this problem. Environmental changes not only have an impact on people’s daily lives, but it also has a subtle influence on gender. Since seldom people have done the research and there are seldom informations on this topic, it is necessary to explore this area. This paper discusses the phenomenon that has appeared along with climate change in human society: gender inequality. It discusses the relationship between the emission of carbon dioxide and the sex ratio on birth, referred to as climate change and gender issue. Using single and multivariate regression model, the result indicates that there is a linear relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and sex ratio at birth, which means the change of sex ratio at birth is related to the emission of carbon dioxide. The deficiency of the research and the improving way are discussed.

<h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a><center>Introduction</center></h3><p>
&emsp;&emsp;With the global stable and rapid development, its opposite side begins to show up in the people’s sights. This problem has gradually attracted people's attention and affects people's life nowadays. The rapid growth of technology and economics has inevitably caused environmental damage. Some environmental problems, such as air pollution and the decrease in biodiversity, have become increasingly serious, which causes more and more people to begin to pay attention to this problem. Many organizations try to advocate the importance of protecting the environment and call on people to minimize pollution. Meanwhile, some countries also decide to join forces and make some contributions to improve the environment since the progress on the environment cannot be accomplished by any single country, but requires the efforts of people around the world. The most well-known plan would be the Paris Agreement, which mainly focuses on addressing the environmental problem. Among several environmental problems, the most crucial one that is valued by the public is climate change. Melting glaciers cause sea levels to rise, which could increase the risk of catastrophic flooding and accidentally kill people living near the coast; the rising of sea level will also cause many people to become homeless, which makes people hard to get into school and indirectly make the average education level decrease in that region, leading to a more widespread problem of poverty; since the high temperature would hinder crops' growth, extreme weather makes food supply inadequate, which makes considerable farmers lose their economic resources; and insufficient food supplies cause the increase of market prices, resulting in that people need to pay for a higher price to buy the crop (From Climate Change to Action, 2020; Climate Change and Health, 2020). Although there are several issues caused by global warming that are widely known by the public, perhaps the consequences of the rising temperature are not only limited to these effects, they are not the only reason that makes all the countries pay attention to global warming. Global warming also causes inequality in society; to be more specific, they also have an incredible impact on the equality between males and females. The gender issue plays an essential role in influencing human society and it has become so paramount these days. While the environmental impact of climate change have been studying for several years, there are limited research focusing on its social impact in a quantitative perspective. So, it is meaningful to use a quantitative method to research the relationship between the environmental problem and the gender issue.
</p>


<h3 id="Method"><a href="#Method" class="headerlink" title="Method"></a><center>Method</center></h3><p>
&emsp;&emsp;World Bank Open Data, which is a database that provides data about the world in public, is used for this research. One of the main concepts of this research, climate change, could be represented by its branch: global warming. Since carbon dioxide emission is the main factor which causes global warming, the carbon dioxide emissions is the most suitable factor to refer to the problem of global warming. The ratio of the birth of the female as the reference value for measuring gender inequality. Several sets of data will be used to analyze the relationships between these two representatives by creating single variable regression model and multivariable regression models. The confidence interval is 95 percent and the significant p value equals 0.5.

<h3 id="Results"><a href="#Results" class="headerlink" title="Results"></a><center>Results</center></h3><p>
&emsp;&emsp;As shown in Figure 1, there is a positive linear relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and Sex ratio at birth. However, there are still some other factors that should be considered. According to the Research Group of "Birth Sex Ratio" of China Population Information Research Center stated in 1993, the sex ratio at birth largely depends on the decline of the fertility rate; additionally, the original imbalance of the ratio of man to the woman also influence the result of the sex ratio at birth. Therefore, two other factors, the total population of females and the fertility rate, are taken into account in this research.

<p>
In Table 1, the adjusted R square is approximately 0.993, which indicates that the model shows that the sex ratio at birth is closely related to the emission of CO2 based on adjusting for the additional two factors. In table 2, the correlation coefficient of sex ratio at birth is-2602000000(95% confidence interval from -4240000000 to -964553059, p-value less than 0.05). When adding the total fertility rate and the total population of females to the scope of the consideration, the value of the correlation coefficient of sex ratio at birth has changed greater than 10% compared to that in the single regression model, which means that these two factors are valid to count as the confounders in this research.
</p>

<h3 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a><center>Discussion</center></h3><p>
According to the result, it can be concluded that there is association between carbon dioxide emissions and the sex ratio at birth. However, there are still some limitations restricting the research to imply to the broader region. For example, The data is only about China, but global warming is a problem faced by the whole world. Concerning that climate change is a global issue, this research lacks reliable data that ensure the completeness and accuracy of this analysise. Additionally, the data varies from 2007 to 2014. This limitation causes two primary deficiencies. First of all, this is a relatively short period of time. Secondly, since the latest data is only until 2014, the research did not cover the latest phenomenon. In the past few years, this problem may have occurred tremendously by being more serious or better. However, this research can only refer to global warming before 2014. Furthermore, there are many different aspects of factors that influence the sex ratio at birth. Although carbon dioxide emissions could be counted as a factor that influences the sex ratio at birth, there is no denying that it played a small role in influencing the rate. This can be improved through finding a more reliable indicator which is more representative of gender equity.

<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><center>Conclusion</center></h3><p>
The environmental issue has an enormous impact on all over the world in many aspects, like economics, poverty, and education. However, the environmental issue does not limit these problems; it also has effects on human society, such as gender equity. There is seldom research on the topic of the relationship between the environmental issue and the gender equity, so this research could help people to have a better understanding of this issue. Using the data from World Bank Open Data database, this research proved that there is association between carbon dioxide emission change and the change of sex ratio at birth in China from 2007 to 2014 through multivariate regression model. Due to the lack of data, the accuracy and representativeness of the results is limited. Meanwhile, the unsuitable representatives caused the result to have a small applicable area.
